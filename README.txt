Netgem Test - JS

1) Open index.html in a web browser

2) Open Invoice.js in a text editor


The goal of this test is to implement the class Invoice so that it behaves as expected and responds properly to the function calls listed in the webpage.

You only have to modify then JS file, not the HTML file.
