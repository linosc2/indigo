Netgem Test - Canvas

1) Open index.html in a web browser

2) Open canvas.js in a text editor

3) Open HTML5_Canvas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf in a PDF viewer or print it


The goal of this test is to implement the function drawCanvas() so that the canvas on the left reproduces the image appearing on the right side of the webpage.

You only have to modify then JS file, not the HTML file.
